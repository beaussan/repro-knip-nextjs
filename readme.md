# Knip reproduction

There is two scripts that can help with the reproduction :

- `npm run knip:entry`: this uses the `entries` from the configs directly
- `npm run knip:plugin`: this uses the `plugin#entry` from the config


Entries works, but from my understanding, `plugin#entry` should work too.
